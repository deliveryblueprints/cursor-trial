# üêõ Snake Game Playwright Test Bug Report

**Date:** August 11, 2025  
**Test Environment:** Playwright v1.40.0  
**Browser:** Chromium  
**Test Suite:** Food Visibility Tests  
**Overall Status:** üü° Partially Working (83% Success Rate)

---

## üìä Executive Summary

The Playwright test suite for the Snake Game has been successfully implemented and is mostly functional. Out of 12 food visibility tests, **10 tests passed** and **2 tests failed**. The core food positioning and visibility functionality is working correctly, but there are issues with the debug text overlay display.

**Key Success:** Food generation is now properly constrained within the 32x24 grid bounds, resolving the original food visibility issue.

**Key Issues:** Debug text overlay not displaying, affecting visual debugging capabilities.

## üêõ Detailed Bug Reports

### **BUG #1: Debug Text Overlay Not Visible**

**Title:** Debug text overlay "Canvas: 800x600 | Grid: 25x25 | Tiles: 32x24" not displaying

**Severity:** Medium  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Status:** Open

**Description:**
The debug text overlay that should display canvas dimensions and grid information is not visible during testing. This affects the ability to verify the food positioning system visually and debug positioning issues.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Start the snake game
2. Enter player name and start beginner level
3. Look for debug text overlay at top of canvas
4. Expected: "Canvas: 800x600 | Grid: 25x25 | Tiles: 32x24" should be visible
5. Actual: Text is not found

**Affected Tests:**
- `tests/food-visibility.spec.ts:61` - "should show food canvas position in debug info"
- `tests/food-visibility.spec.ts:264` - "should display comprehensive debug information"

**Expected Behavior:**
The debug overlay should display:
- Canvas dimensions: 800x600
- Grid size: 25x25 pixels
- Tile count: 32x24 (768 tiles)

**Actual Behavior:**
Debug text overlay is not visible, causing test failures with 5000ms timeout.

**Technical Details:**
- Test timeout: 5000ms
- Locator: `text=Canvas: 800x600 | Grid: 25x25 | Tiles: 32x24`
- Error: "Timed out 5000ms waiting for expect(locator).toBeVisible()"
- Screenshot: Available in test-results folder
- Video: Available in test-results folder

**Root Cause Analysis:**
The debug text drawing code in the `drawGame()` function may not be executing properly, or the text may be drawn but not visible due to:
- Z-index/layering issues
- Text color/background conflicts
- Canvas clearing overwriting the text
- Timing issues with text rendering

**Impact:**
- Reduces debugging capabilities for food positioning issues
- Makes it harder to visually verify grid system
- Affects test coverage for debug features

### **BUG #2: Test Environment Setup Complexity**

**Title:** Playwright test configuration requires manual web server startup

**Severity:** Low  
**Priority:** Low  
**Status:** Open

**Description:**
The Playwright tests require a manual web server startup (`python3 -m http.server 8000`) before running, which adds complexity to the testing workflow and CI/CD integration.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Try to run tests without starting web server
2. Expected: Tests should run automatically
3. Actual: Tests fail with "net::ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND" errors

**Affected Tests:**
- All tests fail when web server is not running

**Expected Behavior:**
- Tests should automatically start web server
- Tests should run without manual intervention
- CI/CD integration should work seamlessly

**Actual Behavior:**
Manual web server startup required before test execution.

**Technical Details:**
- Web server: Python HTTP server on port 8000
- Configuration: `playwright.config.ts` has webServer section but may not be working
- Error: "net::ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND at file:///snake-game.html"

**Impact:**
- Additional setup steps for developers
- CI/CD pipeline complexity
- Reduced test automation

## üîß Recommended Fixes

---

### **Fix #1: Debug Text Overlay (High Priority)**

**File:** `snake-game.html`  
**Function:** `drawGame()`

**Current Code (if exists):**
```javascript
// Debug: Draw food position indicator and grid bounds at top of canvas
ctx.fillStyle = '#ff0000';
ctx.font = '12px Arial';
ctx.fillText(`Canvas: 800x600 | Grid: 25x25 | Tiles: 32x24`, 10, 20);
```

**Recommended Fix:**
```javascript
// Ensure debug text is drawn first and is highly visible
ctx.save(); // Save current context
ctx.fillStyle = '#ff0000'; // Bright red
ctx.font = 'bold 14px Arial'; // Bold, larger font
ctx.textAlign = 'left';
ctx.textBaseline = 'top';

// Draw background for better visibility
ctx.fillStyle = 'rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.9)';
ctx.fillRect(5, 5, 300, 30);

// Draw debug text
ctx.fillStyle = '#ff0000';
ctx.fillText(`Canvas: 800x600 | Grid: 25x25 | Tiles: 32x24`, 10, 20);

// Draw food coordinates if available
if (food && typeof food.x === 'number' && typeof food.y === 'number') {
    ctx.fillText(`Food at: (${food.x}, ${food.y}) | Canvas pos: (${food.x * 25}, ${food.y * 25})`, 10, 40);
}

ctx.restore(); // Restore context
```

**Testing:**
- Verify text is visible in browser
- Check text positioning and readability
- Ensure text persists during gameplay

---

### **Fix #2: Test Environment Automation (Medium Priority)**

**File:** `playwright.config.ts`

**Current Configuration:**
```typescript
webServer: {
  command: 'python3 -m http.server 8000',
  url: 'http://localhost:8000',
  reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI,
  timeout: 120 * 1000,
}
```

**Recommended Fix:**
```typescript
webServer: {
  command: 'python3 -m http.server 8000',
  url: 'http://localhost:8000',
  reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI,
  timeout: 120 * 1000,
  stdout: 'pipe',
  stderr: 'pipe',
}
```

**Alternative: Use Node.js server**
```typescript
webServer: {
  command: 'npx serve . -p 8000',
  url: 'http://localhost:8000',
  reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI,
  timeout: 120 * 1000,
}
```

**Testing:**
- Verify web server starts automatically
- Check port availability handling
- Test CI/CD integration
